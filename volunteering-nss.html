  <h2 class="section-title">Context</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      The National Service Scheme (NSS) at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College focuses
      on structured social engagement through education, women’s empowerment,
      environmental action, and community welfare. Activities are organised
      through long-term projects as well as large-scale campus and public events.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="section-title">Progression into leadership</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I joined NSS as a volunteer and was actively involved in multiple initiatives
      during my first year. In my second year, I was entrusted with the role of
      Secretary. While many volunteers were operationally active, my prior
      grassroots experience and organisational background positioned me to take
      on broader responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Secretary, I worked closely with the Office Bearers to redesign the
      organisational structure, streamline coordination, and scale the impact
      of ongoing projects.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="section-title">Organisational restructuring and recruitment</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      One of my first responsibilities was overseeing the annual recruitment
      process. I designed a two-stage interview framework, including question
      design, evaluation criteria, and final selection, and directly supervised
      the process from outreach to onboarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to onboarding new volunteers, we audited the existing structure,
      consulted previous office bearers, and introduced department heads across
      functional areas such as content, social media, photography, and logistics.
      This restructuring enabled clearer delegation and accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following recruitment, the organisation scaled to over 110 volunteers, with
      nearly half being newly inducted members.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="section-title">NSS Week and large-scale execution</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Within the first month of office, I led the planning and execution of NSS
      Week, a college-wide, week-long programme organised around NSS Day. Due to
      overlapping college elections, the responsibility for ideation, planning,
      and execution fell almost entirely on me.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed the overall event framework and individual activities</li>
      <li>Delegated responsibilities through department heads</li>
      <li>Managed budgets under strict financial constraints</li>
      <li>Coordinated with vendors, speakers, and external partners</li>
      <li>Secured sponsorships in exchange for promotional visibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A campus-wide NSS Fest was organised as part of the week, including themed
      events such as an ethnic day, interactive stalls, and fundraising games,
      all of which saw strong student participation.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="section-title">Project oversight and year-round impact</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      NSS initiatives were structured under four long-term projects focusing on
      women’s empowerment, child education, environmental action, and animal
      welfare. I directly oversaw the women’s empowerment project while remaining
      actively involved in education initiatives.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conducted regular teaching sessions for children in nearby communities
      </li>
      <li>
        Organised educational visits and creative workshops for students
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitated hygiene awareness and empowerment sessions for women
      </li>
      <li>
        Led environmental and animal welfare initiatives on and off campus
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Over the year, the team collectively organised more than 100 initiatives,
      including blood donation drives, awareness campaigns, relief distributions,
      and college-wide events.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="section-title">Recognition and external engagement</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I was felicitated by the Delhi Police on Women’s Day for contributions
      towards social welfare, particularly in the areas of women and child
      empowerment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also played a key role in organising an election awareness campaign in
      collaboration with the Election Commission of Delhi. The initiative was
      formally recognised, and I received a special certificate for my
      contribution. The engagement later developed into a long-term mentorship
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role as Secretary was formally acknowledged by the college during its
      annual fest, where I was awarded a trophy in recognition of leadership and
      service.
    </p>
  </div>

<section>
  <h2 class="section-title">Reflection</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Leading NSS taught me how to manage complexity under constraint. It shaped
      my ability to design systems, delegate responsibility, and execute at
      scale while remaining grounded in the communities being served.
